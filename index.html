    <h2>About Mizuba Tea Co. & Our Love of Matcha</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Mizuba is Built on Relationships.</b>
      We're not about being a business. 
      We're about you, me, and the cups of tea in between. 
      We're about being named as an official Uji-cha tea dealer by our farmers via the Kyoto Chamber of Commerce.
      We're about direct-trade and transparent sourcing: personally knowing our suppliers & tea farmers.
      We're about giving back to where we came from, with a portion of our profits supporting our relationships in Japan.
      We're about how the love of fine tea creates connectivity, culture, and community from source to cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><u>Quality</u></b>
      We're about purveying the most excellent matcha possible since 2013 - only the teas we choose, drink, and enjoy ourselves.
      We're about purely being a single-ingredient, single-origin product.
      We're about sourcing from our JAS-organic certified farm & our 100-year old family matcha tea manufactory.
      We're about non-gmo, radiation-free, preservative-free, sugar-free, absolutely pure matcha tea. 
      We're about committing to the region of Uji–recognized in Japan as the highest quality tea growing region, and as the birthplace of Japanese green tea. Being able to share this matcha is a complete blessing and a gift, and as such, Mizuba hopes to impart just a taste of the larger, beautiful experience of Uji with you, the drinker. With every sip of Mizuba you take, you help continue to make Uji’s history as vibrant as the color of Matcha itself.
    </p>
    <h2>What is Matcha? Where does Matcha come from?</h2>
    <p>A common question we get is <em>"Is Matcha Japanese?"</em> Matcha (抹茶) is historically revered, as the only tea used for over 800 years in the renowned Japanese Tea Ceremony. 
        Contemporarily prized, one cup of Matcha contains numerous health benefits that boost a healthy lifestyle. 
        Extraordinarily versatile, one can drink Matcha as a warm & rejuvenating experience–or bake it into endless variations of delectable tea-inspired treats.

    </p>
    <p>Matcha is the pearl of Japanese green teas. Mizuba matcha comes from the same plant all tea comes from (Camellia sinensis). However, quality matcha green tea is shade-grown for 4 weeks before harvest, and stone-milled into a fine powder from whole <em>"tencha"</em> tea leaves. 
        Mizuba Matcha is a single-region, single-ingredient tea from small, family manufactories that we personally know and visit in Uji, Japan (just outside of Kyoto). Finding information about matcha on the Internet is fairly easy, but the question is if that information is accurate, complete, and honest.
        Mizuba strives to uphold tradition, transparently educate our customers with knowledge directly from our matcha producers, and also provide a deeper knowledge and understanding of what matcha actually is as a finely crafted tea: how it is cultivated, produced, and enjoyed.
        Matcha has a long, celebrated heritage of being the only tea used in Japan's iconic tea ceremony, but it is only recently that the world is discovering Matcha's exciting, diverse uses–making it a popular consumer beverage and baking ingredient. Enjoy Matcha as a pure, hot tea, but also use it to make delicious café lattes, smoothies, cookies, cakes, salad dressings, muffins...you name it!  
        To see how we drink, cook or bake with Mizuba Matcha, check out our videos or blog for awesome recipes.
        Mizuba's exceptional-quality Uji Japanese Matcha is renowned for its wonderful health benefits and excellent flavor profiles across all 6 grades. Bring home our beautifully crafted teas today.
